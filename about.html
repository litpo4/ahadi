                    This is the document that traces the origin of property as well as 
                    all other relevant conveyance deeds. It is the main document that 
                    determines ownership of a property. Since tracing ownership should 
                    always begin with scrutiny of the earliest document recorded, where 
                    such documents are not available, certified copies have to be obtained 
                    from the registering authorities. These documents are called mother 
                    or parent documents

                IS BUYING LAND A GOOD INVESTMENT?

            <div class="panel">
                <p>Most of the time, buying land is a good investment. One, however, 
                    needs to invest in due diligence, to avoid getting conned.

                    It is imperative to conduct a land search at the land registry 
                    in the location where you want to buy land; the point here is to 
                    confirm the ownership of the land you intend to buy.
